      description: 'I built a full-stack AI card generator app that generates Pok√©mon-like cards by custom training a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) with a unique 96x64 architecture. I trained the model on 11,000 images, which is served via a FastAPI backend. The RESTful API handles real-time model inference and manages a full-stack community gallery. The gallery\'s state is persisted in a PostgreSQL database optimized with custom SQL indexes to support "Popular" and "Recent" sorting. The backend is Dockerized and deployed on Render, communicating with a Vercel-hosted client that sends an on-load request to mitigate cold starts.',

      description: 'I built a 64-bit Y86 processor to better understand the fundamentals of computer architecture. The design implemented six pipelined stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory, write, PC update) with 19 instructions, 15 registers, and a 4 KB memory for variable length instruction fetching. I engineered control logic to handle hazards and jumps, then validated the design by running Y86 assembly programs in both a simulator and my implementation, achieving full functional parity. Overall, this project was really fun and taught me more about a side of computer science I rarely visit',
